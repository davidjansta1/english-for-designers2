HOW TO be less addicted to anything

I was sitting in the english class.

Then suddenly my teacher asked me about my topic.

I wasnt sure which topic should I choose and said to him that I dont know yet.

But I was holding an ice coffee and I said that it coule be for example about overcoming caffeine addiction.

This topic was throw away for me but when I was writing about AI and its influence on creative industry, I wasnt that much inspired.

I was also thinking about different topics like painting and some other ones. But then I came back to this one.

And then I quickly realised there is something way deeper in this topic.

Something thats not just about addiction and could be beneficial for anyone anytime.

So first of all. I was kinda addicted.

Througout few years I was extremely addicted to caffeine.

At some points it was so bad I had to drink it almost all the time.

I drank atleast 2x-3x more than recommended maximum intake for an average person.

And when I didnt have it I was extremely tired and empty.

And I wanted to overcome it many times.

It was like 1 month of drinking, then realising im drinking extremely dangerous amount and the next month I was reducing it.

Then another month came in and I was in the dangerous zone back again.

It was impossible for me to overcome it.

Till my heart started to hurt.

It seemed like im going to have heart attack at so many points and for the first time in my life I actually started to think that this stupid thing will kill me.

And I was afraid as never.

I was ok and my heart was healthy.

It was all in my head. Doctor said these were panic attacks.

The next day I havent drank any coffee.

Just a little bit of tea which has Thein which is different kind of one.

And over the next 2 weeks as well.

But then I started to drink at least 1 small coffee per day and there were days I had two.

With drinking a lot of tea.

Sure I havent overcome my addiction.

But I atleast reduced it and when I look at coffee I think that I cant just slip back.

I just cant. Its not even an option for me right now.

At least for now.

And it was just because I had a strong WHY.

I actually determined why i wanna stop doing it and the Why was really strong.

And I thought about different things.

Probably almost anything we do have some sort of WHY.

And what about using it to our advantages.

The next time when you think about starting some good habit or overcoming the bad one, maybe just actually sit down and think about why you wanna stop.

Actually visualise bad stuff.

And actually feel like it happened.

And maybe it could save you a lot of time and willpower
